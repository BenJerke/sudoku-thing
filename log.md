- Got a grid printing method working
- Figured out a crude way to set values in squares with user input
- Working out validating updates now (10:12AM)
### HOLY CRAP WORKING PROTOTYPE!!!!!!!!!!!
- OK, couple things to test: 
    - Will the validation method allow me to update the value in a square that's already set? 
    - Does the validation method work for columns? 
    - Does the validation method work for rows? 
    - Does the validation method work for boxes? 

## 5/30/23
- Created Game, GridSquare, and Main classes
- Decided to set x and y coordinates in GridSquare, which would inform Game where the square was located
- Using Game to house all the logic for gameplay activities: printing the grid, updating squares, stuff like that.
